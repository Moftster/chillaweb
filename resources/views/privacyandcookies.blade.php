    <h3 id="pr-01">Why we value your privacy</h3>
    <p>We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we&#8217;re committed to keeping your personal and business information safe. We’re uncomfortable with the information companies, governments, and other organisations keep on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from our customers. We&#8217;ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we&#8217;ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re forced to by law.</p>
    <h3 id="pr-02">How we collect information</h3>
    <p>We ask for contact information including your name and email address when you sign up to our website so that we can verify your identity.</p>
    <p>Our website doesn&#8217;t use cookies or scripts that were designed to track the websites you visit. We don&#8217;t use analytics or native social media &#8216;like&#8217; or &#8216;sharing&#8217; buttons which also build profiles of your internet activity.</p>
    <p>We ask for your account and contact information when you hire or buy something from us.</p>
    <p>Occasionally, we might receive your contact information from one of our partners. If we do, we protect it in exactly the same way as if you give it to us directly.</p>
    <h3 id="pr-03">What information we hold</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>When you contact us by email or through our website, we collect your name and email address if you've given us that.</li>
    <li>If you sign up for a newsletter, we only collect your email address.</li>
    <li>When you buy something from us, we collect your name, email address, phone number, and a delivery address.</li>
    <li>If you do business with us, we also collect your business name and bank details and keep records of the invoices we send you and the payments you make.</li>
    <li>All purchases are processed by Stripe, our ecommerce platform and we never have access to your credit card information.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you sign up through our website, we store your your information in a secure MySQL database. When you buy something, your information is stored in our MySQL database and if we do business, we store your information in our accounts software FreeAgent.</p>
    <h3 id="pr-05">What we use your information for</h3>
    <p>We occasionally use your contact information to send you details of our products and services. When we do, you have the option to unsubscribe from these communications and we won’t send them to you again. We might also email you about our products and services, but if you tell us not to, we won&#8217;t get in touch again. We will use your information to send you invoices, statements, or reminders.</p>

    <h3 id="pr-07">Who has access to information about you</h3>
    <p>When we store information in our own systems, only the people who need it have access. Our management team have access to everything you&#8217;ve provided, but individual employees have access to only what they need to do their job.</p>
