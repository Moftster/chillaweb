    <h3 id="pr-01">Why we value your privacy</h3>
    <p>We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we&#8217;re committed to keeping your personal and business information safe. We’re uncomfortable with the information companies, governments, and other organisations keep on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from our customers. We&#8217;ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we&#8217;ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re forced to by law.</p>
    <h3 id="pr-02">How we collect information</h3>
    <p>We ask for contact information including your name and email address when you request a quote on this website so that we can verify your identity and follow up to discuss your project further.</p>
    <h3 id="pr-03">What information we hold</h3>
    <p>When you contact us by email or through our website, we collect your name, email address and phone number if you've given us that.</p>
    <p>When you buy something from us, we collect your name, email address, phone number, and a delivery address.</p>
    <p>If you do business with us, we also collect your business name and bank details and keep records of the invoices we send you and the payments you make.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="pr-04">Where we store your information</h3>
    <p>When you sign up through our website, we store your your information in a secure database. When you buy something, your information is stored in our database and if we do business, we store your information in our accounts software.</p>
    <h3 id="pr-05">What we use your information for</h3>
    <p>We occasionally use your contact information to send you details of our products and services. When we do, you have the option to unsubscribe from these communications and we won’t send them to you again. We might also email you about our products and services, but if you tell us not to, we won&#8217;t get in touch again. We will use your information to send you invoices, statements, or reminders.</p>
    <h3 id="pr-06">Who&#8217;s responsible for your information at our company</h3>

    <h3 id="pr-08">The steps we take to keep your information private</h3>
    <p>Where we store your information in third-party services, we restrict access only to people who need it.</p>

    <h3 id="pr-10">How we use cookies</h3>
    <p>We use cookies to do a few things:</p>
        <p>• To remember information about you, so you don't have to give it to us again and again</p>
        <p>• To keep you signed in, including across different devices</p>
        <p>• To help us understand how people are using our services, so we can make them better</p>
        <p>• To help us personalise the site to you by remembering your preferences and settings. </p>
    <h3 id="pr-11">Changes to the policy</h3>
